                        Basque Cheesecake is a relatively new disk. It is said to have originated in 1990 in San Sebastian,Spain. The original recipe has a handful of ingredigents: cream cheese, cream, sugar, eggs, and flour. Basque Cheesecake is often called "Burnt" cheesecake due to its iconic rich dark surface. Unlike American cheesecake, Basque cheesecake does not have a crust. The high temperature forms a caramelized exterior that serves as a natural crust for the cheesecake.
